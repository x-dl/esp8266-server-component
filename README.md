# Server Component üöÄ
## Preface
This server component is used for system monitoring and data analysis. <br>
And it seems that just add a thread to your existing embedded platform,The impact on the behavior of the original embedded platform is minimal.<br>
And greatly improve your understanding of embedded systems, giving you a different vision.<br>
#### Attention:Rar file contains examples of development boards based on spot atom Explorer, which can be run directly.But its context is not the latest version
## Architecture

### Introduce
#### Hardware is consist of the TIM„ÄÅUART„ÄÅDMA.
#### Operate System is FreeRTOS.Other real-time operating systems may be added later.
#### On the basis of the original embedded service software, add the sever component.(Almost no impact on your existing embedded system)
## How to apply it
### first situation(your development board is explorer from zhengdianyuanzi)
The way to use it is incredibly simple<br>
1. Download the threadx_dbs.c source file.
2. Add this file to your original embedded project.
3. Create the thread(Threads need to be created before they can be used).<br>
### second situation(your development board is not explorer from zhengdianyuanzi)
The way to use it maybe a little difficult
1. Download the threadx_dbs.c source file.
2. Add this file to your original embedded project.
3. Add corresponding hardware driver,modify it on the original frame.This Step may cost you a lot of time.
4. Create the thread(Threads need to be created before they can be used).
## Initialization Process
Assume that you have created the thread.
to be continue...
